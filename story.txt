  There once was a boy who decided that peanuts were too hard for his teeth. Coming to this conclusion, he ascended the highest peak of Mt. Arachis Hypogaea, and sat there meditating for two thousand and sixty four years. His concentration was stellar; hunger, sleep, reasoning, never got in the way of his goal. One day, an epiphany came upon him, as he continued in his daily routine. A strange voice told him that to soften his peanuts, he would need to perform an ancient ritual known only to the oldest elders, all of whom have died off. He was given the knowledge, and for the first time in a very long time he stood up and stretched. With his willpower renewed, he returned home in order to gather the supplies he needed: a bowl, water and peanuts.
